# Art-Auction-Data-Analysis

Case Study from Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: [Google Data Analytics Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)

## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform data analysis on the art auction dataset collected by *Kangsan Lee et al.*. This dataset was initally found on the [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-08-07-edition/) website and also was published [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60957-z). I will use this dataset to analyze trends and patterns for a fictional art magazine client and highlight the main pieces for consideration in future publications.

## Context
Working for a fictional art magazine client, the company wants to analyze trends and patterns found on art auctions to highlight insights in the art market. To do so, they want to see which styles, mediums, and artists are gaining in popularity. The editor wants to identify up and coming patterns that can resonate with art enthusiasts and readers to help drive which topics to highlight in future articles. For example, if the data shows a rise in demand for a specific style, the editorial team can focus on these areas to stay ahead of the industry. This not only extends to  magazine/print media but also for publishing web-based articles as well. 

## Step 1: Ask

**Business Task**: Analyze art auction data to identify trends and help guide editorial content for future publications.

**Analysis Questions**: The stakeholders and team brainstormed a few possible questions to help find trends within the data.
- What genres/mediums of art has been rising within the past few years?
- What regions have been identified as highest revenue for art auction transactions?
- Is there a correlation between different auction houses and revenue?

For this case study, we'll touch on each question to give an overall idea for further actions.

## Step 2: Prepare
